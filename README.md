# Hi there! 🙋‍♂️

I'm Marcelo Ortiz-Villavicencio, an Economics Ph.D. student @ Emory University 

My research interests lie at the intersection of:
- Econometrics
- Causal Inference
- Statistical Learning
- Applied Microeconomics

I’m also enthusiastic about Causal Reinforcement Learning (Dynamic Treatment Regimes & Personalized Policy Learning), Statistical Optimal Transport, and Experimental Design.

I've previously worked in the tech industry as Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer.

Feel free to hit me up if you think our interests align - I bet we'll find some cool stuff to talk about!
